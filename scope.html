                        <p>Today, technology has become an important part in everyone’s life, making it nearly impossible to survive in any field without it. Education is one of those fields which use technology for its development and enhancement in order to obtain the desirable outcome. Combining technology and education has opened new opportunities for immersive learning environments, and it has brought education to a level which makes it more beneficial and effective for the students. Among different kinds of technologies which have been used for educational advancements, Augmented Reality (AR) has become one of the most popular technologies these days. It is being used as a new medium to combine aspects from ubiquitous computing, tangible computing, and social computing. Moreover, it has its own characteristics and benefits that are promising to support learning and make students more interested in learning. Since AR brings lots of benefits to the field of education, many research studies have been carried out to emphasize its true usage in this field.</p>
						<p>Rita Layonaa, Budi Yuliantob, and Yovita Tunardi together have carried out a study to develop an AR application for human body anatomy learning to make it easier for students to understand the content clearly. For collecting data for the research, a questionnaire has been distributed among 48 junior and senior high school students of a higher education institution in Jakarta, Indonesia. As mentioned in the research, this application enables students to learn human body anatomy with 3D object interaction, and previously it was taught using textbook and mannequin, and therefore, students have faced a difficulty in understanding its content. As a solution, this application has provided the three-dimensional practice form for the students to visualize the anatomy of a two-dimensional body shape.</p>
						<p>Similarly, another research has been carried out to develop an AR mobile application to learn railway transportation. As mentioned in this research, this AR application has been tested among 18 users, and as per the results gained from the testing process, using the AR application has made its users to learn boring and difficult subjects in a more interesting way.</p>
						<p>Another research has been carried out about applying augmented reality technology using a marker-based approach in the E-learning system for transmitting virtual objects into the real-world scenes. According to this research, there are two approaches for transmitting virtual objects into the real world scene: Marker-based and Monitor-based registration approach. Finally, the research has indicated that a subject which is explained using several pages can be eliminated by replacing it with a small marker. </p>
						<p>In another research carried out by Kamalika Dutta, the benefits and the detriments of AR with regard to e-learning have been emphasized. Furthermore, this research has explained some relevant aspects which need to be considered in order to identify the true benefits of the AR technology in order to improve the learning processes. Similarly, V. Camilleri and M. Montebello have emphasized in their research that the industrial-age approach has added barriers between the “classroom” setting and the real world, and AR is one of those powerful technologies which can break these barriers. Moreover, the following advantages of AR have been mentioned in the research.</p>
						
						<p>•	Flow in balancing inactivity and challenge.</p>
						<p>•	Repetition allows learners to repeat their experimentation until they are satisfied with the outcomes.</p>
						<p>•	Experimentation in encouraging learners to try and learn in the process.</p>
						<p>•	Experience which is more engaging than other digitally mediated technologies.</p>
						<p>•	Doing through practice.</p>
						<p>•	Observing through an essential communication platform.</p>
						<p>•	Motivation stimulated by the people’s own active part.</p>
						
						<p>Apart from the above-mentioned studies, another research has presented four applications developed using augmented reality for e-learning; two has focused on collaborative work of students and the other two on biology and geography. As mentioned in the paper, the use of images, 3D models, sounds and animations are the important factors in AR which get the attraction from the students, and it is more effective than the classical teaching methods. The paper has explained further that these augmented elements allow students to retain new information more easily, and tests designed as games contribute to reduce their stress. This paper has mainly focused on indicating the use of augmented reality in order to improve the communication and collaboration skills between children, especially autistic children, and the game-based evaluation of pupils in various teaching areas, allowing for a stress free testing environment.</p>
						
						<p>According to the above-mentioned facts, it is clear that AR is one of the most effective and powerful technologies which can be used to improve the field of education. Also, it is evident that, in Sri Lanka, this technology is still not being used for the purpose of enhancing the education of our children. Therefore, implementing an AR application can be highly important for Sri Lankan students, and it can surely be useful to obtain the educational advancements, and encourage the students for learning.</p>

						<p>In different countries, different researches have been carried out to enhance the educational level of their students using AR, but in Sri Lanka, it has not been used. Therefore, a huge gap can be seen between the existing applications and the new application. The following table is a summarized comparison that shows the gap in order to emphasize the importance of the newly implemented application. </p>

                        <p>National Examinations department statistics of the previous two years [9] show that the amount of students who have passed science is comparatively lower than other main subjects.</p>
						 <img src="images\Scope\Scope_RProblem1.jpg"/>
					<p>Figure 1 depicts that the amount of students who have passed science is somewhat low than other major subjects and Figure 1 depicts that the amount of students who have scored higher grades at the ordinary level examination is low.  Most of the students have scored average grades (c and s).</p>
					<p>There are several reasons for the inability of most of the students to score higher grades in science.</p>
						<p>•	The concepts of science are complicated and hard to understand.</p>
						<p>•	Some students are not much interested in studying science.</p>
						<p>•	Lack of proper practical experience as some schools are not having proper lab facilities.</p>
				
				<p>The survey we conducted in order to gather requirements for our research shows the value of using 3D technology in learning science.</p>
					 <img src="images\Scope\Scope_RProblem2.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>
					 
					 <p>Above figure  shows that about 71% of the students who took part in the survey are having difficulties in studying science</p>

						<p>Above figure shows that mobile phone usage is not a new thing for O/L students.So using a mobile application will not be a hard task for students.<p>
					<img src="images\Scope\Scope_RProblem4.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>
					<p>Above figure shows that most of the students would like to learn science using 3D technology.</p>
					<img src="images\Scope\Scope_RProblem5.jpg" width="500px" height="300px"/>
					<p>Above figure shows that most of the students are interested in using a 3D application to study instead of reading long notes.  According to our survey results mentioned above we can ensure that our proposed application will definitely be a great support to uplift O/L results in Sri Lanka.</p>

                        <p> The developed solution for the problem discussed above is a mobile application
							which uses augmented reality to support ordinary level students in Sri Lanka in their
							science subject. Augmented reality is the technology used in the app to teach even
							hard concepts in an interactive way. A survey was carried among several O/L
							students in Sri Lanka to investigate the areas which most of the students need support
							in their Science subject. The analysed results of the survey were considered in
							developing the application. The developed mobile application was implemented as a
							combination of four major components. Those are, </p>
							
							<p>●	  AR support on the study of the human body</p>
							<p>●	  AR support on the study of plant bodies</p>
							<p>●	  AR support on studying about acids   </p>
							<p>●	  AR support on the study of the biosphere.</p>
							
							<p>All these four components are providing AR support for students in studying the relevant areas of the O/L Science syllabus.  Augmented reality is a growing field of technology and using it in elearning purposes provides the ability to demonstrate even complicated concepts using an attractive manner.  So this application would be helpful to provide an effective method for O/L students to easily grab even harder concepts of their Science syllabus easily.  This will also create an interest among O/L students to study Science due its attractive nature of teaching.  </p>

								<p>Under “Biosphere Cycles” mainly two cycles have been discussed: Carbon cycle and Nitrogen cycle.  Using this part of the application, students can view 3D models for the above cycles while listening to an audio explanation playing in the background.  In order to do that, phone camera should be pointed to the relevant cycle image in the textbook.  When the camera detects the 2D image of the Carbon cycle it will display a 3D Carbon cycle model.  Also, when the camera detects the 2D image of the Nitrogen cycle it will display a 3D Nitrogen cycle model.  The 2D images of the two cycles are stored in the Vuforia database as the markers, and the 3D models will be displayed when the camera identifies the exact marker in the textbook.  Moreover, the application facilitates students to learn these cycles in Sinhala and English languages, and they can choose it according to their preference.  Also, it provides the notes related for the two cycles.  The following Figure shows how the application will display the 3D model of the Carbon cycle. </p>

								<h1 style="text-color:red">Acids</h1>

					           <p>The Acids component is a solution to provide support for students in studying the lessons relevant to acids in the Science syllabus.  The component is using augmented reality to cover the content relevant to acids. The component is developed in a manner which can provide students an engaging experience on the content and also students will be able to get a practical experience even without using any lab equipment.</p>
								<p>According to the task performed the component is subdivided into three sub components.</p>
									<p>●	 Visualisation of acidic bonds using augmented reality.</p>
									<p>●	 Demonstrating experiments for the reactions between acids and elements.</p>
									<p>●	Converting descriptions on productions done by acids, into image slideshows using augmented reality.</p>
						
						
						<p> This component will demonstrate the molecular structure of acids, productions done by acids and the reactions between acids and elements using 3D models, animations, videos and audios.  The underlying technology which was used to fulfil these tasks was augmented reality.</p>
					
						<h2 style=text-color="red">A. Demonstrating 3D models using augmented reality</h2>
							<p>This feature was used to demonstrate the molecular structure of acids.  Once the user captures a formula of an acid the application will identify the captured formula and a suitable 3D model will be retrieved from the Vuforia database and it will be displayed on top of the captured formula.</p>

								<h5 style="margin-top:15px">Figure 7 : 3D model of an acid</h5>
								
					<p>Above figure shows how the 3D model of the HNO3 acid is displayed using augmented reality once the application identifies the formula of HNO3 using the mobile camera.</p>
					
					
					<h2>B. Playing videos/ audios on an image target using augmented reality</h2>
						<p>Once the user captures an equation of a reaction between an acid and an element an experiment will be demonstrated using augmented reality.  This will be useful for students with less laboratory facilities.  Even without any materials they can get an experience on the experiments related to acids in the O/L syllabus.
Audios are also played along with the AR content in order to give students the ability to understand the concepts more clearly.  The content in the textbook relevant to acids will be presented in a more attractive and simplified way by combining audios to the AR demonstrations.
</p>
					
					<h2>C. Image slideshows using augmented reality</h2>
						<p>This feature was used to convert detailed text based descriptions into attractive image slideshows using augmented reality.  Once the user captures a detailed text based description about the production of a particular acid an attractive image slideshow will be played using augmented reality.  This would be more effective than reading detailed descriptions.</p>
